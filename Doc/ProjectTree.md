# Project Tree
Displays and organizes the contents of your current scxml project and any scxml files it contains. You can perform many important project management tasks, such as adding, removing scxml files, etc. The default location of the Projects window is the upper right corner of the IDE, but the window is dockable and you may dock it to any other place you wish.

## Root node

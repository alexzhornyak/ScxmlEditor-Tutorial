This is a fully manual test.  You send a well formed event to the 'location' URL
 specified for your SCXML interpreter and check that you get a 200 response code back.  
 One way of doing this, using wget, is shown below (you can use any event name you
 want, but you must use '_scxmleventname' to indicate the name of the event):

$ wget \
--post-data='key1=value1&key2=value2' \
--header '_scxmleventname: test' \
<!-- URL of your processor goes here -->
